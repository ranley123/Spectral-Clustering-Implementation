## Overview
This is for Spectral Clustering by using K-Means algorithm. The number of clusters k is unknown, which can be derived from the Laplacian Matrix. 

The implementation strategy is based on the link https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/introduction-to-spectral-clustering/#:~:text=Spectral%20clustering%20is%20an%20EDA%20technique%20that%20reduces,into%20clusters%20of%20similar%20data%20in%20rarer%20dimensions.
